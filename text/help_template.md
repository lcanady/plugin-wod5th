# Template

Splat allows you to set one of the available types of characters to make on the
game, vampire, mortal, etc. You must set your splat before you can begin setting
your stats. Once your splat is set, you'll have to `tempalte/reset` before you
can set your splat again. Using `tempalte/reset` will reset your entire
character sheet.

Usage: `template [<target>=]<template>`
