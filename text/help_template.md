# Template

Splat allows you to set one of the available types of characters to make on the
game, vampire, mortal, etc. You must set your template before you can begin
setting your stats. Once your template is set, you'll have to `tempalte/reset`
before you can set your template again. Using `tempalte/reset` will reset your
entire character sheet.

Usage: `template [<target>=]<template>`
